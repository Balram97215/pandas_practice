# 🐼 Pandas Practice Notebooks

**A collection of Python notebooks created for practicing data manipulation and analysis using the Pandas library.**

---

## 🎯 Project Goal

This repository serves as a personal portfolio piece to demonstrate proficiency in core data manipulation and analysis using the **Pandas library**, specifically covering the following topics and techniques:

* **Data Ingestion, Filtering, and Sorting** (`01_Getting_&_Knowing_Your_Data`, `02_Filtering_&_Sorting`).
* **Data Structure** (Creating Series and DataFrames).
* **Aggregation and Transformation** (`03_Grouping`, `04_Apply`, `05_Merge`, `06_Stats`).
* **Data Cleaning and Indexing** (`10_Deleting`, `11_Indexing`).
* **Time Series Analysis** (`09_Time_Series`).
* **Visualization** (`07_Visualization`).

By completing these exercises, the repository proves the ability to handle structured datasets for real-world analytical and data science applications.
